It is likely that this work was etched in Paris and was published in 'Twelve Etchings from Nature' (the 'French Set') in 1858. A translation of the title is 'Old Rag Woman' or 'Old Rag Seller.'",

One gets the sense that the painting captures a contemplative moment of rest painted outdoors.",

The sitter of this rather loosely painted sketch of a man reading is most likely Nicola d’Inverno, the artist’s manservant who was in his service from the 1890s through 1917. The painting may have been painted at the inn at Purtud in the Italian Alps, where Sargent and his friends spent several summers between 1904 and 1908.",

The viewer is prompted to look up into the sky and behold the wonder of the balloon with the group of peasant farmers. Hot air balloons had been in use in Europe since the 1780s but even one hundred years later, in the 1880s, balloons were a rare sight, inspiring awe, especially in the French countryside.",

    "description":"By the early 1920s, there were several exquisitely landscaped resort hotels that attracted the attention of Cooper, who was born in Philadelphia and who had studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. El Encanto (The Enchanted) became a favorite location for the artist. He made several paintings of the pond and pergola. This painting is a foreshortened view of the pond looking out toward the pergola and eucalyptus trees in the distance. The lush landscape is bathed in sunlight exhibiting his mastery of the plein air technique.",

This painting was completed in 1886, the year the artist visited Japan with his friend, historian Henry Adams. The loosely handled brush work combines a sense of the exotic and a somber tone. The artist published a book in 1897 titled, An Artist’s Letters from Japan, one of eight books and numerous essays LaFarge wrote over the course of his career.",
